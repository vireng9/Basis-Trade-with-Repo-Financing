# **Relative Value Arbitrage – Basis Trade with Repo Financing**

## **Mechanics:**
•	Cash Treasury (Leg 1) – The hedge fund buys a Treasury bond in the cash market.
•	Financing – The purchase is financed using repurchase agreements (repo), where the bond acts as collateral to borrow cash.
•	Futures Short (Leg 2) – Simultaneously, the fund sells short a corresponding Treasury future contract.
•	Objective – Profit from the narrowing of the price differential (‘basis’) between the cash bond and the futures by settlement date. Any coupon income and financing cost (repo rate) are factored into the profitability calculation. 
•	Leverage – The use of repos allows large leverage, often 30 – 60 times capital, making small price differences profitable at scale.

## **Key Risks:**
•	Rollover risk – The repo market is typically overnight or very short-term, so positions must be constantly rolled over. If repo rates spike or funding dries up, the position can become costly or even impossible to maintain.
•	Liquidity risk – Markets can become illiquid during stress. In March 2020, for example, repo rates surged and margins increased, prompting large unwinds and resulting in negative price moves for Treasuries.
•	Margin risk – Futures legs require margin. Rising margin requirements can force early liquidation of trades, leading to losses.
•	Basis widening / Convergence risk – If the cash-futures basis does not converge as expected or widens, the trade loses money.
•	Systemic risk – Large concentrations of leveraged basis trade across funds can create vulnerabilities, particularly if many players unwind simultaneously.

### **Recent Trends (2024- 2025)**
•	Trade Size – Gross notional exposure for basis trades remains at $ 1  2 trillion, the highest ever.
•	Central Bank Backstops – The NY Fed’s Standing Repo Facility now acts as a funding safety net, helping to dampen forced selling risk and stabilize markets during volatility (seen in April 2025).
•	Regulatory Changes – The SEC is expanding central clearing for Treasuries through the Fixed-Income Clearing Corporation, with significant dates from late 2025 into 2026. This reduces bilateral risk, improves margin efficiency, and promotes market stability.
•	2025 Events – Despite April 2025 market volatility from tariff news, repo funding, and basis positions remained notably stable, in contrast to previous crises.
•	Ongoing risks – Financial stability concerns persist, as basis trades are exposed to funding and liquidity shocks. Regulators remain alert to the systemic risk posed by concentrated, leveraged positions.
